                        It was good. I was really captivated throughout. I wouldn't say that the ending was a let down, 
                        but perhaps it would've been better if the 'adults' didn't save them at the end. 
                        I was more expecting Ralph to die and for the true nature of Jack to be amplified further. 
                        Despite this it was still very good, and one I will read again sometime.
