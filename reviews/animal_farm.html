                        I read this tiny book in a couple of hours. The vocabulary used wasn't difficult at all, 
                        and was only just over a hundred pages. However, it managed to convey such a powerful message about 
                        power and intrinsic human greed through the parody of Stalin's communism.

                        “Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, 
                        he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. 
                        Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that 
                        will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.” <br><br>

                        “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”
