                        I'm glad that I read it, however it was a very frustrating book. It is a great love story in the sense that 
                        Heathcliff is completely and utterly in love with Cathy, but the toxicity of the situation was at times 
                        very hard to overlook. As I said, I'm very glad that I read it but I don't see myself reading it again in the future.
