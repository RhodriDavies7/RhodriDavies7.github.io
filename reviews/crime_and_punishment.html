                        This was a very long read. But I'm glad of that. This is without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read, 
                        despite how dark and heavy the topic may seem. The ending definitely didn't let me down. Absolutely amazing.

                        "Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, 
                        I think, have great sadness on earth"<br><br>

                        "Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted more."<br><br>

                        "'But those men succeeded and so they were right, and I didn't and so I had no right to have taken that step'. 
                        It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful 
                        and had confessed it."<br><br>

                        "How it happened he did not know, but all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet.
                        He wept and threw his arms around her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. 
                        She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes. 
                        She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come... They wanted to speak, 
                        but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, 
                        of a full resurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other."
