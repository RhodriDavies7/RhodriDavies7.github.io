                        "Fuck me, that's a good book. Holy shit". That is what I said when I finished this book. 
                        I'm not a religious man and am doubtful that I'll ever proclaim my faith to a God. However, 
                        after reading this book I believe that I have a better understanding of the word faith and those who follow religions. 
                        For it is rules like these that govern faith, force us to better ourselves and to be better for others. 
                        God is the idea of what these rules suggest, and heaven isn't a place we go when we die, 
                        but the place we create and leave behind when we all follow, the 12 rules for life.

                        "Imagine a Being who is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent. What does such a Being lack? The answer? Limitation.<br><br>
                        "If you are already everything, everywhere, always, there is nowhere to go and nothing to be. 
                        Everything that could be already is, and everything that could happen already has. And it is for this reason, 
                        so the story goes, that God created man. No limitation, no story. No story, no Being."
